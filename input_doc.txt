We consider summarization in this module. To facilitate the discussion, we consider summarization of a single given document There are two modes of summarization: extractive and abstractive. An extractive summarization of a given document is a subset of the original document. In other words, an extractive summarizer attempts to determine the most important sentences within the document and presents these sentences as the summarization. An abstractive summarizer provides an abstract of the document. You might think of it this way: a highly trained professional is asked to read a highly technical paper in his/her specialty field and provide a short (one or two paragraph) description of the paper.
This description (often called "the abstract") need not contain any of the sentences from the original paper.

Duo Security is a subsidiary company of the great technology company CISCO and it is responsible for one of the world's trusted authentication systems (the Duo 2nd Factor Authentication System) which is used when logging onto EMU's systems and many other systems. This company is not only well-aligned with my new acquired technical skills but also my passion (Data Analytics) and I am happy to join this visionary company for the next 3 months. I will be carrying out tasks that involve retrieving data from databases and cleaning this data to make it available for further analysis to find trends and look for possible solutions to automate this process.
